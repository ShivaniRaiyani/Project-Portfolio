üìÅ Project Portfolio


Welcome to my project portfolio!  I‚Äôm a passionate Android Developer and Team Lead with over 7 years of experience building high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly mobile applications. I specialize in Kotlin and Java, and have led multiple end-to-end projects using modern Android architecture such as MVVM, Firebase, and REST APIs.
I‚Äôve overseen sprint planning, code reviews, architecture design, and delivery pipelines across various domains including healthcare, eCommerce, and social networking. I enjoy mentoring developers, solving complex technical challenges, and bringing innovative mobile experiences to life through clean code and thoughtful design.
Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I approach scalable architecture, real-time features, third-party integrations, and team-ready code!
