📁 Project Portfolio
Welcome to my project portfolio! I am an Android and Flutter developer with over 8+ years of hands-on experience in building high-quality mobile applications. Below is a curated collection of projects I've worked on, including brief descriptions, the technologies used, and links to source code or live demos.

With more than 8 years in mobile app development and over 30+ successful projects delivered, I specialize in building high-performance Android and cross-platform applications using Flutter.

My journey began with native Android development (Java/Kotlin), and over time, I expanded into Flutter to create scalable, modern, and feature-rich apps for both Android and iOS platforms.

I've contributed to and led projects across diverse domains—e-commerce, fintech, healthtech, and social platforms—handling end-to-end development from architecture planning to deployment and maintenance. I'm passionate about crafting seamless user experiences and writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
