# 📁 Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio!  
I’m a passionate **Android Developer** and **Team Lead** with over 7 years of experience building high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly mobile applications. I specialize in **Kotlin** and **Java**, and have led multiple end-to-end projects using modern Android architecture such as **MVVM**, **Firebase**, and **REST APIs**.

I’ve overseen sprint planning, code reviews, architecture design, and delivery pipelines across various domains including healthcare, eCommerce, and social networking. I enjoy mentoring developers, solving complex technical challenges, and bringing innovative mobile experiences to life through clean code and thoughtful design.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see how I approach scalable architecture, real-time features, third-party integrations, and team-ready code!
